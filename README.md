# Usage

See the [tests](tests/mod.rs) for example usage.

# Examples

```cli
cargo run --example ipns-entry
```

# Tests

`cargo test --workspace`

# Build from Source

To build, you will need your env var `PROTOC=` set to the bin location where protoc is saved,
as this uses [prost](https://github.com/tokio-rs/prost) to generate the Rust files from Proto files.

This is done in the [build step](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/build-scripts.html#build-scripts) using `./build.rs`.

The generated rust files are saved by prost to the `target/../build/ipns-entry-*/out/` directory.
